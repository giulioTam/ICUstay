# ICUstay
This notebook presents a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the length of stay (LOS) in the ICU for patients diagnosed with diseases of the digestive system using the MIMIC-III dataset. The goal is to estimate the expected duration of ICU stay early in the admission process, which can help optimize resource allocation and patient care.
